Before submitting, replace the text in this README file with your name and a brief description of your work (just a sentence or two will do).

To be honest, I approached this project as a way to get full credit in the fastest and easiest way possible. And if you looked at my website and understood how I am still trying to tackle the waitlist, you will understand why. I still wanted to use both kinds of lists because its fun to see the juxtaposition. But this is a silly little personal bio and I hope you enjoy!
